# Project Overview

Graph Sudoku is an application which was created with three goals in mind:
- Teach Jetpack Compose
- Teach Graph Datastructure & Algorithms (Directed Colored Graph)
- Build a simple and fun app

It uses my general purpose software architecture (model-view-nobody-WHATEVER) which is basically just applied separation of concerns.
